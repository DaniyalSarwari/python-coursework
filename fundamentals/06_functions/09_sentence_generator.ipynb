        "Implement the helper function `make_sentence(word, part_of_speech)` which will take a string word and an integer part_of_speech as parameters and, depending on the part of speech, place the word into one of three sentence templates (or one from your imagination!):\n",
        "\n",
        "If **part_of_speech** is **0**, we will assume the word is a noun and use the template: `\"I am excited to add this ____ to my vast collection of them!\"`\n",
        "\n",
        "If part_of_speech is 1, we will assume the word is a verb use the template: `\"It's so nice outside today it makes me want to ____!\"`\n",
        "\n",
        "If part_of_speech is 2, we will assume the word is an adjective and use the template: `\"Looking out my window, the sky is big and ____!\"` `make_sentence(word, part_of_speech)` should not return anything, just print the correct sentence with the word filled in the blank.\n",
