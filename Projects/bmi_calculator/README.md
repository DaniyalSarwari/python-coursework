### **Objective:**

Use variables and mathematical operators in Python to calculate a person’s **Body Mass Index (BMI)**.



### **Task Description:**

The **Body Mass Index (BMI)** is a measure used in medicine to check if someone is underweight or overweight.
The formula to calculate BMI is:

**BMI = weight / (height × height)**

---

### **Instructions:**

1. Create a new Python file named **`bmi_calculator.ipynb`**.
2. Add a comment at the top describing the purpose of your program.
3. Ask the user to enter their **weight** in kilograms and **height** in meters.
4. Convert this sentence into Python code:

   > “BMI is equal to the person's weight divided by the person's height squared.”
5. Display the calculated BMI on the screen.

---

### **Example Output (for reference only):**

```
Enter your weight in kilograms: 60
Enter your height in meters: 1.65
Your BMI is: 22.03
```

---

### **Bonus Challenge (Optional):**

After calculating the BMI, display a message showing whether the person is:

* Underweight
* Normal weight
* Overweight
